# Executive Sales Dashboard | Power BI Project

# Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data using the **Contoso Dataset**. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable business insights by creating an interactive and professional dashboard.

# Tech Stack & Skills
- **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- **Data Modeling:** Implemented a **Star Schema** architecture (Fact and Dimension tables).
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Created custom measures for key business metrics such as:
  - Total Sales & Profit Margin
  - Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth
  - Regional Performance Analysis
- **ETL Process:** Used **Power Query** for data cleaning, transformation, and normalization.

# Key Features of the Dashboard
- **Executive Summary:** High-level KPIs for quick decision-making.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualizing sales performance over time to identify seasonality.
- **Product Performance:** Detailed breakdown of sales by category and subcategory.
- **Interactivity:** Integrated slicers and drill-through actions for deep-dive analysis.

# Project Structure
- `PowerBI_Sales_Analysis_YourName.pdf`: A detailed report containing screenshots and descriptions of the dashboard's logic and visuals.
- `ContososalesPowerBI.pbix`: The original Power BI source file (available upon request or link to Drive).

# How to View
Since the full .pbix file is large, you can view the complete analysis and the interactive charts in the **PDF Portfolio** included in this repository.
