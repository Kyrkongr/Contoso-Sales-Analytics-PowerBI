# Sales Analytics Portfolio - Contoso Dataset
I built this Power BI dashboard to analyze retail performance and profitability using the Contoso dataset. This project was developed as part of my preparation for graduate studies in Data Science, focusing on data modeling and the extraction of actionable business insights.

What’s inside
The analysis focuses on three main pillars:

Data Modeling: A clean Star Schema architecture to ensure report performance and data integrity.

DAX Logic: Custom measures for calculating YoY (Year-over-Year) growth, profit margins, and sales trends.

UI/UX: An interactive interface designed for end-users to drill down into specific product categories and regions.

Project Documentation
Due to the large size of the original Power BI file, I have documented the entire dashboard and the analytical logic in a PDF report.
